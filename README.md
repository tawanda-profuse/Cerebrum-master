# YeduAI: Autonomous Web Application Generation

This autonomous system represents a significant leap in application development, leveraging artificial intelligence and modular architecture to translate user prompts into functional React applications. The system is designed with a focus on flexibility, scalability, and maintainability, ensuring it can adapt to diverse user requirements and evolving technological landscapes.

## System Overview

This document outlines the architecture and operational logic of an advanced autonomous system designed to generate React applications from user prompts. The system leverages a suite of JavaScript and Node.js files to interpret user requirements, construct application architecture, and ensure the final product aligns with the initial specifications.
